# ScheduleMaker

## Product Proposal

## Vision Statement

For Temple University students who need assistance planning course schedules. ScheduleMaker is a minimal web application that displays multiple scheduling options based on course selections, unlike Temple's current registration system. Our product will produce all possible schedules based on the courses requested, removing the need for students to figure out all their schedule options manually.
